## Entry template

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — Short title
**Symptom:** what you actually saw (error text, wrong output, hang)
**Cause:** the real root cause
**Fix:** what worked
**Dead ends:** what looked right but wasn't, and why
**Affects:** src/path/to/file.ts

## 2026-08-12 — `.gitignore` does not cover `.env`
**Symptom:** `.env` is tracked in git despite a large "Secrets / config" section in
`.gitignore`.
**Cause:** That section only lists `credentials*`, `secrets*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`.
There is no `.env` pattern, and a file already tracked stays tracked even after a matching
pattern is added.
**Fix:** Not applied — the repo owner opted to leave credential handling as-is for now.
Anything spawned from this template inherits both the tracked `.env` and the pattern gap.
**Dead ends:** Adding `.env` to `.gitignore` alone does nothing for an already-tracked
file; it needs `git rm --cached` as well.
**Affects:** `.gitignore`, `.env`, `.mcp.json`, `.claude/mcp.vscode-reference.json`

## 2026-08-12 — The two MCP config files disagreed on hosts (RESOLVED)
**Symptom:** `.mcp.json` pointed at `<lan-ip>`–`.126`;
`.claude/mcp.vscode-reference.json` pointed at `<lan-ip>:7801`–`7806`.
**Cause:** The stack migrated from a single docker-compose host (`.186`, one port per
service) to native OCI containers on Proxmox node `<lan-ip>` (CTIDs 120–126, **one
IP per server**). `.mcp.json` was updated; the reference file was not.
**Fix:** `.120`–`.126` is current. The reference file was realigned to `.120` and the
stale `.186:78xx` addresses removed.
**Dead ends:** We initially guessed the `.186` file might be the newer one because
`AGENTS.md` still described a docker-compose stack — the prose was simply stale too. The
`// description` comment in `.mcp.json` is the reliable source here, not the prose.
**Affects:** `.mcp.json`, `.claude/mcp.vscode-reference.json`

## 2026-08-12 — mcp-compressor 0.31.4 changed its CLI flags
**Symptom:** Server configs written with `--compression-level` and `--header` fail on
current mcp-compressor. Backends without an `Authorization` header fail differently —
mcp-compressor auto-attempts OAuth discovery, which these backends don't support.
**Cause:** 0.31.4 renamed `--compression-level` → `--compression`, `--header` → `-H`, and
now requires a `--` separator before the backend URL and its args.
**Fix:** Use `--compression`, `-H`, and `--`. For backends with no real auth, pass a
placeholder `-H "Authorization=Bearer unused"` to suppress OAuth discovery.
**Dead ends:** Omitting the Authorization header entirely looks correct for an unauthed
backend, but triggers the OAuth path and fails with an unrelated-looking error.
**Affects:** `.mcp.json`, `.claude/mcp.vscode-reference.json`

## 2026-08-12 — A newly created `.claude/settings.json` does not load in the session that created it
**Symptom:** Added `permissions.deny` / `permissions.ask` rules, then ran `dropdb --help`
(matches the `ask` rule `Bash(dropdb*)`). It executed straight through to
`bash: dropdb: command not found` — no prompt, no block.
**Cause:** The settings watcher only watches directories that already contained a settings
file when the session started. `.claude/settings.json` did not exist at session start, so
the new file stays invisible until the session restarts (or `/hooks` is opened, which
reloads config). Nothing wrong with the file — it parses and matches the published schema.
**Fix:** Restart the session, or open `/hooks` once. Verify afterward with a harmless
matching command such as `dropdb --help`.
**Dead ends:** Re-checking the JSON and the rule syntax — both were correct the whole time.
The failure looks exactly like a bad matcher pattern, which is the trap: **a permission
rule that silently doesn't load is indistinguishable from one that doesn't match.** Same
class of invisible-failure problem that got `mem0` dropped. Probe with a real command
rather than assuming the rules are live.
**Affects:** `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/skills/guard-destructive/SKILL.md`

## 2026-10-06 — Fortune "not working" on most blocks is a vanilla anti-duplication design
**Symptom:** Fortune does nothing on logs, sand, dirt, etc., which looks like a bug to fix.
**Cause:** Multiplying a block that drops itself (or drops something that crafts back into
it) is an infinite loop: mine 1, get 3, place them, mine again. Vanilla caps melon at
9 slices and glowstone at 4 dust, exactly one block's worth, for this reason. Silk Touch +
Fortune on ores is the same loop.
**Fix:** Don't multiply self-drops. Add non-placeable byproduct drops instead (DESIGN §6,
Q13), and keep any loop-creating mode behind an off-by-default toggle with a warning.
**Dead ends:** A blocklist of storage blocks only. It misses plain self-dropping blocks
(logs, sand), which loop just as well.
**Affects:** DESIGN.md §4, §6; Phase 8
